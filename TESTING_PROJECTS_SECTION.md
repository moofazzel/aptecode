## Common Issues to Watch For

### Edge Browser Issues
1. **Mix blend mode not working**: Should be fixed with CSS module implementation
2. **Gradient not appearing**: Vendor prefixes should resolve this
3. **Flickering on hover**: GPU acceleration should prevent this

### Mobile Issues
1. **Double-tap required**: onClick handler should fix this
2. **No visual feedback**: Touch indicators address this
3. **Scroll triggered on tap**: `e.preventDefault()` should prevent this

### General Issues
1. **Hover stuck after tap**: State management handles this
2. **Multiple cards active**: State ensures only one active at a time
3. **Link not clickable**: `e.stopPropagation()` prevents parent click

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Desktop User Flow
1. User hovers over project card
2. Details appear smoothly
3. User reads description
4. User clicks arrow to view portfolio
5. Expected: Smooth experience, all effects work

### Scenario 2: Mobile User Flow
1. User sees "Tap to view" badge
2. User taps card
3. Details appear
4. User reads description
5. User taps arrow to view portfolio
6. Expected: Clear interaction, no confusion

### Scenario 3: Keyboard User Flow
1. User tabs to project card
2. User presses Enter
3. Details appear
4. User tabs to arrow link
5. User presses Enter to navigate
6. Expected: Full keyboard accessibility

## Debugging Tips

### If hover doesn't work in Edge:
1. Check browser console for CSS errors
2. Verify CSS module is loading
3. Check if `mix-blend-mode` is supported
4. Inspect element to see computed styles

### If touch doesn't work on mobile:
1. Check if touch events are firing (add console.log)
2. Verify state updates correctly
3. Check for z-index conflicts
4. Ensure pointer-events are correct

### If animations are choppy:
1. Check DevTools Performance tab
2. Verify GPU acceleration is active
3. Reduce will-change usage if needed
4. Check for layout thrashing
